# Pink Pulsating Pancreas

## MCU software

This software was designed to run on a
[dmxfire16](https://github.com/propane-and-electrons/dmxfire16), but should
work on any Arduino-ish (ATmega328) platform.

The [DMXSerial](http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/DMXSerial.aspx) library
(v1.4.0) is required, and can be installed using the Arduino Library Manager.
